    Compute a neighborhood graph of observations [McInnes18]_.

    The neighbor search efficiency of this heavily relies on UMAP [McInnes18]_,
    which also provides a method for estimating connectivities of data points -
    the connectivity of the manifold (`method=='umap'`). If `method=='gauss'`,
    connectivities are computed according to [Coifman05]_, in the adaption of
    [Haghverdi16]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        Annotated data matrix.
    n_neighbors
        The size of local neighborhood (in terms of number of neighboring data
        points) used for manifold approximation. Larger values result in more
        global views of the manifold, while smaller values result in more local
        data being preserved. In general values should be in the range 2 to 100.
        If `knn` is `True`, number of nearest neighbors to be searched. If `knn`
        is `False`, a Gaussian kernel width is set to the distance of the
        `n_neighbors` neighbor.
    {n_pcs}
    {use_rep}
    knn
        If `True`, use a hard threshold to restrict the number of neighbors to
        `n_neighbors`, that is, consider a knn graph. Otherwise, use a Gaussian
        Kernel to assign low weights to neighbors more distant than the
        `n_neighbors` nearest neighbor.
    random_state
        A numpy random seed.
    method
        Use 'umap' [McInnes18]_ or 'gauss' (Gauss kernel following [Coifman05]_
        with adaptive width [Haghverdi16]_) for computing connectivities.
        Use 'rapids' for the RAPIDS implementation of UMAP (experimental, GPU
        only).
    metric
        A known metricâ€™s name or a callable that returns a distance.
    metric_kwds
        Options for the metric.
    key_added
        If not specified, the neighbors data is stored in .uns['neighbors'],
        distances and connectivities are stored in .obsp['distances'] and
        .obsp['connectivities'] respectively.
        If specified, the neighbors data is added to .uns[key_added],
        distances are stored in .obsp[key_added+'_distances'] and
        connectivities in .obsp[key_added+'_connectivities'].
    copy
        Return a copy instead of writing to adata.

    Returns
    -------
    Depending on `copy`, updates or returns `adata` with the following:

    See `key_added` parameter description for the storage path of
    connectivities and distances.

    **connectivities** : sparse matrix of dtype `float32`.
        Weighted adjacency matrix of the neighborhood graph of data
        points. Weights should be interpreted as connectivities.
    **distances** : sparse matrix of dtype `float32`.
        Instead of decaying weights, this stores distances for each pair of
        neighbors.

    Notes
    -----
    If `method='umap'`, it's highly recommended to install pynndescent
    ``pip install pynndescent``.
    Installing `pynndescent` can significantly increase performance,
    and in later versions it will become a hard dependency.
